Everything related to rotations in robotics and optimization
## What are rotations? I'll do you one better, why are rotations?
If you ever worked with robotics, you know that rotations are a big deal. They are everywhere, from the kinematics of a robot to the estimation of pose in Computer Vision, SLAM, etc. And there are many ways to represent them (Euler angles, axis-angle, quaternions, 9D rotation matrices, 6D+Gram-Schmidt matrices, etc). This repository is a collection of notes, code, and resources about rotations in robotics and optimization. 

I still find rotations a bit confusing, so I'm trying to understand them better by writing about them. I hope you find this repository useful. If you have any suggestions or catch any mistakes, please let me know.
